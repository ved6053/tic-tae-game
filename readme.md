When I was in college, I was unable to write program for this game
I am learning python, and wrote this game by own without help of internet, Which give me true happiness
I was unable to judge balls in my childhood, One person gives me complement, if you could try and 
mittigate this challege , you could become great foot ball player,
since you are loving football in childhood, but you did not play football because of fear
this define me a fixed mindset person
Today I am learing and progressive, hence I tried writing this game by own

5. select player
6. accept input on board
